Installation Complete
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Thank you for using the mod template, set up by Apache.

Within the sample `ModSystem`, there is a client-side command, as a basic example of how the mod works.
You should be able to set this project as the start-up project for the solution, and run the mod immediately.
Once logged in, you should be able to type `.hello` in chat, and see the result, `"Hello World!"`, displayed as a chat notification.
You can delete this file, once you have verified that the game can load the mod, and run the command.

First Time Users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If this is your first time using the mod template, and you have just set up your Environment Variables within
the wizard, you will likely see a number of errors, and the mod will not run. This is because Visual Studio needs
to be restarted, in order for the Environment Variables to be refreshed. Once you reopen your solutions, these
error messages will disappear, and you'll be good to go.

Finishing Steps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are a number of optional completion steps that you may wish to take.

 • Includes Folder
    - Every file that is placed within the `_Includes` folder will be copied into the mod, when the project is built.
      Use this folder to add assets, a mod icon, other forms of documentation, etc.

 • Assets
    - An `assets` folder has been included, with empty folders for each of the different asset categories.
      Use, or delete these folders, as needed. An English language file has also been included, to show the
      basic principle of translatable strings.

 • Mod Info
    - A minimal `modinfo.json` file has been included; but you should check to make sure all information is correct,
      and add any missing records that your mod will need, in order to run.

 • Readme File
    - A basic `README.md` file has been included, which will be shipped along with your mod.
      You should expand this file, and give information about your mod, and how to use it. You can also use this
      as a template to add to the ModDB page, when you upload your mod.

 • Licensing
    - This mod has come packaged with a standard MIT License, from https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT.
      Feel free to open `LICENSE.md`, and change the licensing text, as per your needs.
