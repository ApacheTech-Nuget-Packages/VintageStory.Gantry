		<PackageReleaseNotes>
			Gantry MDK v0.9.0:
			
			This release has focused heavily on the new bespoke slim implementation of Paramore.Brighter into the MDK. This allows
			usage of the visitor command pattern to create re-usable snippets of code that can be run from anywhere.
			
			Another major change is the proper implementation of app-side determination. ApiEx.Side is now reliable, and works instantly,
			with no caching of threads. This means that use of ApiEx.Current can be safely, and reliably used across all mods, as intended.

			Changelog:
				
			- Added: Bespoke implementation of Paramore.Brighter as a mediator.
			- Added: EasyX Service to make mods like Knapster much easier to create. See Knapster, or MinimalMapping for examples.
			- Added: ExtendedEnums are now expanded to be a standalone service.
			- Added: BrighterChat Service allows for mediated chat command handlers, using BrighterSlim.
			- Added: Humanizer Core as a dependency.
			
			- Fixed: ApiEx.Side now works with `AsyncLocal` to be foolproof.
			- Fixed: Harmony patches degrade gracefully on mod unload.
			- Fixed: 3rd party mod systems are only added to the DI if they load properly.
			- Fixed: Gantry embedded languages are now much more robust, and fallback to `en` if files are not found.
			- Fixed: JOAAT hash method now returns a hex string to reduce redundant code at the point of use.
			- Fixed: Lots of minor bug fixes, code cleans, and refactors throughout the codebase.
