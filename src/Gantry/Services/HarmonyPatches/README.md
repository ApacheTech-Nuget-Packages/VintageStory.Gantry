# Gantry - Vintage Story MDK: Harmony Patching Service

Provides a service for patching the game with Harmony, when using Gantry MDK.

The harmony patching service is a simple, yet powerful solution to streamlining the inclusion of harmony patches within mods.

The service comes with a fully-featured array of tools, such as:

 - sided patch classes that will only be applied on the Server, or Client;
 - default harmony instance, using the mod assembly's full name as an ID;
 - automatic patching of all annotated patch classes within the mod's assembly;
 - manual patching of annotated classes within any assembly;
 - life-cycle management of all harmony instances, and patch classes;
 - game logs of all patched methods, giving full implementation details;

The service also comes with a Dependency Injection satellite library that makes it easy to add the service into the mod's service collection.

## Gantry MDK:

The Gantry Mod Development Kit is a Core Framework that makes it easier to make Code Mods for Vintage Story.

## **Support the Author:**

The Gantry Mod Development Kit is developed, and maintained by me; Apache. 
I'm a freelance developer, a content creator, and and a long time player, and modder, of Vintage Story.
I've contributed code to the game, including a re-write of the translation engine, 
some OpenGL GUI Elements, and a number of optimisations, and bug fixes.

All of this, I've done on a voluntary basis, and as I've been more active within the community, people have requested ways to show support for the work I produce, and the help I've given. So, I have a number of options available, to that end.

Thank you to everyone that does support me, and my work.
