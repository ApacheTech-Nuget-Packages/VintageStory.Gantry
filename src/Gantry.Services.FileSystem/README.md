# Gantry - Vintage Story MDK: File System Service

Provides a service for interacting with the file system.

The file system service allows easy access to files on the hard-drive, as well as embedded resources within the mod's assembly.

The service comes with a fully-featured array of tools, such as:

 - global, and per-world feature settings;
 - file registration, with support for JSON, Text, and Binary files;
 - parsing embedded files to JSON objects or arrays;
 - dynamic application of `INotifyPropertyChanged`, via Harmony;
 - static access to special folders, via `ModPaths`;
 - static access to mod settings, via `ModSettings`;
 - base classes for classes that consume feature settings, such as Harmony patch classes;
 - base classes for feature settings dialogue windows;

The service also comes with a Dependency Injection satellite library that makes it easy to add the service into the mod's service collection.

## Gantry MDK:

The Gantry Mod Development Kit is a Core Framework that makes it easier to make Code Mods for Vintage Story.

## **Support the Author:**

The Gantry Mod Development Kit is developed, and maintained by me; Apache. 
I'm a freelance developer, a content creator, and and a long time player, and modder, of Vintage Story.
I've contributed code to the game, including a re-write of the translation engine, 
some OpenGL GUI Elements, and a number of optimisations, and bug fixes.

All of this, I've done on a voluntary basis, and as I've been more active within the community, people have requested ways to show support for the work I produce, and the help I've given. So, I have a number of options available, to that end.

Thank you to everyone that does support me, and my work.
