		<Description>Provides a service for interacting with the file system, when using Gantry MDK.</Description>
		<Version>0.2.5</Version>
		<PackageReleaseNotes>
			FileSystem Service 0.2.5

			This update mainly concerns fixing a nasty bug with static scope members. The bug caused settings consumers, such as GUIs, and patch clases, to hold settings from previous worlds. The current fix is a jury-rig. It fixes the issue in a very brute force way.

			There is also some internal preparation and forward compatibility for v2 of the file service, and asset management service.

			- Removed: All code-flow regarding "Local" File Scope. (YAGNI)
			- Removed: `SettingsConsumer` abstract class. (DRY Anti-Pattern)

			- Added: Extension methods to aid assembly level reflection.
			- Added: `ISettingsConsumer` marker interface for World and Global Settings Consumers.
			- Added: `IDisposable` implementation to `JsonSettingsFile` class.
			- Added: [EXPERIMENTAL] `FileSystemService` now initialises all settings consumer classes within the mod assembly.

			- Refactor: Changed parameter order in `GetScopedPath`. (Forwards Compatibility)
