# Gantry - Vintage Story MDK

The Gantry Mod Development Kit is a Core Framework that makes it easier to make Code Mods for Vintage Story.

This library is required, and contains the core functionality of the MDK. A lot of the core features are designed to streamline mod development, and allow for rapid prototyping of new mod features.

The Core comes with a fully-featured array of tools, such as:

 - static access to the game's core API, via the `ApiEx` static class;
 - static access to the mod's metadata, via the `ModEx` static class;
 - static access to the game's assemblies, via the `GameAssemblies` static class;
 - extended support for the translation services, via the `LangEx` static class;
 - base classes for "Gantrified", sided `ModSystem` instances;
 - extensive maths library, including multiple interpolation formulae;
 - an encyclopaedia of extension methods for all areas of the game;
 - extension methods to aid functional programming for C#;
 - extension methods to aid reflection calls, using Harmony's `AccessTools`;
 - guard clause collection, accessible via the `Guard` static class;
 - cryptographic helpers, and random number generators;
 - implementation of `JetBrains.Annotations` attribute, `UsedImplicitly`;
 - implementation of `StringEnum<>`, allowing strongly-typed filtration of strings;
 - collection of commonly used strings, translated into every language the game supports;
 - base classes for Modal dialogue windows;
 - support for visual user feedback, via `MessageBox.Show(...)`;
 - scaled image support for displaying images on GUI forms;

## **Support the Author:**

The Gantry Mod Development Kit is developed, and maintained by me; Apache. 
I'm a freelance developer, a content creator, and and a long time player, and modder, of Vintage Story.
I've contributed code to the game, including a re-write of the translation engine, 
some OpenGL GUI Elements, and a number of optimisations, and bug fixes.

All of this, I've done on a voluntary basis, and as I've been more active within the community, people have requested ways to show support for the work I produce, and the help I've given. So, I have a number of options available, to that end.

Thank you to everyone that does support me, and my work.
