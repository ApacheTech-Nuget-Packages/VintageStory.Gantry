## Gantry MDK:

The Gantry Mod Development Kit is a Core Framework that makes it easier to make Code Mods for Vintage Story.

## **Support the Author:**

The Gantry Mod Development Kit is developed, and maintained by me; Apache. 
I'm a freelance developer, a content creator, and and a long time player, and modder, of Vintage Story.
I've contributed code to the game, including a re-write of the translation engine, 
some OpenGL GUI Elements, and a number of optimisations, and bug fixes.

All of this, I've done on a voluntary basis, and as I've been more active within the community, people have requested ways to show support for the work I produce, and the help I've given. So, I have a number of options available, to that end.

Thank you to everyone that does support me, and my work.
